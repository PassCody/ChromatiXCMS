# ChromatiXCMS

Welcome to the ChromatiXCMS repository! This is a project that aims to provide a Content Management System (CMS) with an emphasis on vibrant and eye-catching designs. Please note that this is the developer's first major project and may not be fully optimized in terms of code. Furthermore, this CMS aims at the gaming community. So it should not be used like Joomla or other free CMS for general use.

Please keep in mind that due to the nature of this being the developer's first significant project, the code might not adhere to all best practices and optimizations. However, it serves as an excellent learning experience and a showcase of the developer's journey in improving their skills.
